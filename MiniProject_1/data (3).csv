"Definition"
"The cause of death unit record file is a snapshot of data that is compiled and coded (ICD-10) by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), based on data from the data custodians, that is correct as at a point in time."
"Inclusions & Exclusions"
"Only NSW residents are included."
""
"Coding"
"Deaths are classified using ICD-10 classification and distributed according to ICD-10 chapters."
"Statistical Methods"
"Counts of deaths for the latest year of data include an estimate of the number of deaths occurring in that year but registered in the next year."
"Rates were age-adjusted using the Australian population as at 30 June 2001."
"Dimensions/Variables"
"As Aboriginal people are under-reported on Death Registration Forms, it is likely that the true numbers are higher than shown."
"Local Health Districts (LHDs) are health administrative areas constituted under Section 17 of the NSW Health Services Act 1997 which became effective from January 2011 and were initially called Local Health Networks."
"All LHDs includes LHDs where numbers are too low to be individually included, and records where the LHD was missing or not stated."
"Primary Health Networks (PHNs) are health administrative areas which represent primary health care organisations in Australia from July 2014."
"All PHNs include records where the Primary Health Network is missing or not stated as well as records assigned to the NSW portion of the Murray PHN."
"The Accessibility/Remoteness Index of Australia Plus (ARIA plus) is a remoteness index value (or score) based on road distance to major service centres (GISCA)."
"Statistical Areas are grouped according to Australian Statistical Geographic Standard (ASGS) remoteness categories on the basis of Accessibility/Remoteness Index for Australia (ARIA version) score."
"Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) are produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, with four indexes currently being produced. Index of Relative Socio-Economic Disadvantage (IRSD) is the main index reported by HealthStats NSW. It includes characteristics relating to occupation, education, non-English speaking background and the economic resources of the household."
"Quintiles of socioeconomic status (Index of Relative Socioeconomic Disadvantage) based on the Australian Bureau of Statistics' Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas were allocated based on Statistical Local Area of residence (before 2009) or Statistical Area Level 2 of residence (2009 and after)."
