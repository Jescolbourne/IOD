"Inclusions & Exclusions"
"For the dimensions LHD, PHN, SES and ARIA, only NSW residents are included."
"For other views, data refer to NSW emergency department presentations regardless of the district or state of residence of the patient."
"Persons under 10 years are excluded from intentional self-harm and suicidal ideation categories."
"Includes emergency department presentation types of  'emergency presentations' and 'unplanned return visit for a continuing condition' only."
"Excludes Northern Beaches Hospital."
"Coding"
"Depending on the information system used in the emergency department at a point in time, the diagnosis recorded according to one of three classification systems: the International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision (ICD-9), the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th revision (ICD-10) or the Systematised Nomenclature of MedicineClinical Terms (SNOMED-CT)."
"Details of intentional self-harm and suicidal ideation codes are available here."
"Statistical Methods"
"For the dimensions LHD, PHN, SES and ARIA, figures are based on where a person resides, not where they are treated."
"Age-specific rates were not age-adjusted."
"All other rates are crude rates.Crude rates represent an estimate of the proportion of a population that experiences an outcome during a specified period. The crude rate is calculated by dividing the number of people with an outcome in a specified period by the number at risk during that period (typically per year). The crude rate does not take into account changes in the age structure of the population studied (such as changes in the proportion of people in different age groups over time), and can be misleading when long-term trends are examined, geographic areas or sub-population are compared - because age structures of populations may vary over time, among areas or groups."
"Dimensions/Variables"
"Local Health Districts (LHDs) are health administrative areas constituted under Section 17 of the NSW Health Services Act 1997 which became effective from January 2011 and were initially called Local Health Networks."
"All LHDs includes LHDs where numbers are too low to be individually included, and records where the LHD was missing or not stated."
"Primary Health Networks (PHNs) are health administrative areas which represent primary health care organisations in Australia from July 2014."
"All PHNs include records where the Primary Health Network is missing or not stated as well as records assigned to the NSW portion of the Murray PHN."
"The Accessibility/Remoteness Index of Australia Plus (ARIA plus) is a remoteness index value (or score) based on road distance to major service centres (GISCA)."
"Outer regional and remote includes very remote."
"Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) are produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, with four indexes currently being produced. Index of Relative Socio-Economic Disadvantage (IRSD) is the main index reported by HealthStats NSW. It includes characteristics relating to occupation, education, non-English speaking background and the economic resources of the household."
