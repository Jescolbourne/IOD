"Definition"
"Intentional self-harm includes purposely self-inflicted poisoning or injury or attempted suicide with intent based on notes recorded by the treating clinician. This indicator measures people admitted to hospital after self-harm. It is not a direct measure of the number of people in the NSW population who make suicide attempts."
"Inclusions & Exclusions"
"Patients treated solely within the emergency department are excluded from this indicator prior to 2017/18 due to a policy change impacting hospital admission criteria from this time (PD2017_015). However, a minority of patients being managed in short stay areas of emergency departments are still included."
"Further information about the exclusion of patients treated solely in emergency departments can be found here."
"Rehabilitation records are excluded to allow comparison of consistent trends over time."
"Only NSW residents are included."
"Coding"
"Hospital separations were classified using ICD-10-AM."
"Statistical Methods"
"Figures are based on where a person resides, not where they are treated."
"Numbers for recent years include an estimate of the small number of hospitalisations of NSW residents in interstate public hospitals, data for which were unavailable at the time of production."
"Rates were age-adjusted using the Australian population as at 30 June 2001."
"Spatial adjustment methods were used to calculate the adjusted rates for the local government area views."
"Dimensions/Variables"
"As Aboriginal people are under-reported on the Combined Admitted Patient Epidemiology Data collection, it is likely that the true numbers are higher than shown in this dimension. Additional information can be found on the quality of reporting on Aboriginality in hospital data here."
"Local Health Districts (LHDs) are health administrative areas constituted under Section 17 of the NSW Health Services Act 1997 which became effective from January 2011 and were initially called Local Health Networks."
"Data for some Local Health Districts (LHDs) may not be included individually due to low numbers."
"All LHDs includes LHDs where numbers are too low to be individually included, and records where the LHD was missing or not stated."
"Primary Health Networks (PHNs) are health administrative areas which represent primary health care organisations in Australia from July 2014."
"All PHNs include records where the Primary Health Network is missing or not stated as well as records assigned to the NSW portion of the Murray PHN."
"Local Government Area boundaries used were those as defined in 2016."
"The Accessibility/Remoteness Index of Australia Plus (ARIA plus) is a remoteness index value (or score) based on road distance to major service centres (GISCA)."
"Statistical Areas are grouped according to Australian Statistical Geographic Standard (ASGS) remoteness categories on the basis of Accessibility/Remoteness Index for Australia (ARIA version) score."
"Outer regional and remote includes very remote."
"Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) are produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, with four indexes currently being produced. Index of Relative Socio-Economic Disadvantage (IRSD) is the main index reported by HealthStats NSW. It includes characteristics relating to occupation, education, non-English speaking background and the economic resources of the household."
"Quintiles of socioeconomic status (Index of Relative Socioeconomic Disadvantage) based on the Australian Bureau of Statistics' Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas were allocated based on Statistical Local Area of residence (before 2009-10) or Statistical Area Level 2 of residence (2009-10 and after)."
