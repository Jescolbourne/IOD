"Definition"
"Kessler 10 (K10) is a 10-item questionnaire that measures anxiety, depression, agitation, and psychological fatigue in the most recent 4-week period."
"The categories shown are: Low (K10 between 10 and 15.9), Moderate (K10 between 16 and 21.9), High (K10 between 22 and 29.9), and Very high (K10 of 30 and over)."
"Inclusions & Exclusions"
"Adults are defined as persons aged 16 years and over in the NSW Population Health Survey."
""
"Statistical Methods"
"The K10 questions were included in the survey every year between 2002 and 2011. From 2011 until 2019, the questions were included every second year. The questions were included in the 2020 survey. Data from this lastest survey is available in the bar chart view and table only."
"The indicator shows self-reported data collected through Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI). In order to address diminishing coverage of the population by landline telephone numbers (<85% since 2010), a mobile phone number sampling frame was introduced into the 2012 survey."
"The inclusion of mobile phone numbers has substantially increased the Aboriginal sample and this change in design means that the 2012 NSW Population Health Survey estimates reflect both changes that have occurred in the population over time and changes due to the improved design of the survey."
"Estimates were weighted to adjust for differences in the probability of selection among respondents and were benchmarked to the estimated residential population using the latest available Australian Bureau of Statistics mid-year population estimates."
"To improve estimatation, some reporting groups, for example by Aboriginality, aggregate data over several surveys. In these cases, survey results are aggregated using a moving window of fixed time, namely 3 years."
