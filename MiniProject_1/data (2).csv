"Definition"
"Total drug deaths include all deaths where the ICD-10 codes listed are cited as either the underlying cause of death (i.e. drug-induced) or an associated cause of death (i.e. drug-related; and not drug-induced). This measures the burden related to drug use where the underlying cause may be directly or indirectly associated with drug use. Reports from other groups (including the Australian Bureau of Statistics) only include deaths directly associated with drug use."
"The cause of death unit record file is a snapshot of data that is compiled and coded (ICD-10) by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), based on data from the data custodians, that is correct as at a point in time."
"Inclusions & Exclusions"
"Only NSW residents are included."
""
"Coding"
"Deaths were classified using ICD-10 from 1997 onwards."
"Statistical Methods"
"Counts of deaths for the latest year of data include an estimate of the number of deaths occurring in that year but registered in the next year."
"The ABS undertake a revision process for coroner-certified deaths over a 3-year period. Accordingly, causes of death data for the two most recent years reported are preliminary and subject to two further revisions; data for the third most recent year are revised and subject to another revision; data for earlier years are final."
"Rates were age-adjusted using the Australian population as at 30 June 2001."
"Dimensions/Variables"
"The Accessibility/Remoteness Index of Australia Plus (ARIA plus) is a remoteness index value (or score) based on road distance to major service centres (GISCA)."
"Statistical Areas are grouped according to Australian Statistical Geographic Standard (ASGS) remoteness categories on the basis of Accessibility/Remoteness Index for Australia (ARIA version) score."
"Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) are produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, with four indexes currently being produced. Index of Relative Socio-Economic Disadvantage (IRSD) is the main index reported by HealthStats NSW. It includes characteristics relating to occupation, education, non-English speaking background and the economic resources of the household."
