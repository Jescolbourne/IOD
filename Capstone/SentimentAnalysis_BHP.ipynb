Obviously, this came off of the bad news that we got in the jobs market. So now we have another swing in the opposite direction. AHMED RIESGO: Right, so really, I think the market's not going to be able to rally here in any sustainable way until we get a pivot from the Fed. And a pivot doesn't necessarily mean reduction in rate hikes. It also means a pause. And the jobs number today really did nothing to change that narrative or to push that timetable forward. If anything, I think what we continue to see is continuing strength in that labor market. It's one of the reasons why the Fed has to continue to tighten. That labor market is still quite strong. Remember, there's still 1.6 workers for every job available out there. So there's a big moat around the US labor market. SEANA SMITH: Todd, what do you think of that strong jobs number that we got out this morning, the fact that the unemployment rate continued to fall-- or fell once again, I should say.

Millions of Australians are eligible for refunds after having paid for junk insurance products, with more than half not even aware they are eligible. New research from consumer remediation service Remediator, found that over 50 per cent of Australian consumers who have received junk insurance refunds either didn’t know they held the insurance in the first place or weren’t aware of all the exclusions that meant they would never be able to claim on the policy. Junk insurance refers to add-on insurances like Consumer Credit Insurance (CCI), Guaranteed Asset Protection (GAP), Mortgage Protection Insurance and Loan Protection Insurance.

The Royal Commission exposed the dodgy tactics banks and insurers used to sell these products, like paying as much as four times the commission to sales agents as was ever paid out to customers on policies. The average refund amount is $1,962.76, but some have received significantly more. Remediator said in recent weeks it has been able to deliver as much as $41,449 to a Victorian resident who had been paying for CCI. Remediator found that he had been paying for CCI on his Westpac Credit Card for over 10 years, but he never knowingly signed up for it in the first place. “I never thought in a million years I’d see anything refunded,” the man from Hoppers Crossing said. “It absolutely made my decade.” Another man, from Derrimut South Australia, received a $32,653 refund for CCI on a credit card.

Wall Street has fallen sharply following a solid jobs report for September that increased the likelihood the Federal Reserve will barrel ahead with an interest rate hiking campaign many investors fear will push the US economy into a recession. The Labor Department reported the unemployment rate fell to 3.5 per cent, lower than expectations of 3.7 per cent, in an economy that continues to show resilience despite the Fed\\'s efforts to bring down high inflation by weakening growth. Non-farm payrolls rose by 263,000 jobs, more than the 250,000 figure economists polled by Reuters had forecast. Money markets raised to 92 per cent the probability of a fourth straight 75 basis-point rate hike when Fed policymakers meet on Nov. 1-2, up from 83.4 per cent before the data. The job gains, lower unemployment rate and continued healthy wage growth point to a labour market Fed officials will likely still see as keeping inflation too high. In the latest of the hawkish messages by policymakers, New York Fed president John Williams said more rate hikes were needed to tackle inflation in a process that will likely increase unemployment. Friday\\'s data cemented another jumbo, 75 basis-point rate hike in November as \"the labour market is still way too hot for the Fed\\'s comfort zone\", said Bill Sterling, global strategist at GW&K Investment Management. \"This was a classic case of good news is bad news,\" he said. \"The market took the good news of the robust labour market report and turned it into an ever-more vigilant Fed and therefore potentially higher risks of a recession next year.\" Next week\\'s consumer price index will provide a key snapshot of where inflation stands. Despite Friday\\'s nosedive, a hefty two-day rally earlier in the week pushed the S&P 500, the Dow and the Nasdaq to post their first week of gains after three straight weeks of losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 630.15 points, or 2.11 per cent, at 29,296.79, the S&P 500 lost 104.86 points, or 2.80 per cent, to 3,639.66 and the',\n",

In our status-hungry brains, the question matters. Sometimes someone looks down their nose at your suburb. Is that still deserved? Or if you’re impressed by someone’s address, could its glitzy reputation be out of date? Impressions can well last longer than reality. Cities change over time.

And can you use this information to buy a perfect house in a part of Australia that is suddenly unfashionable but actually still lovely?

The prison was first opened in 1809 as a depot for French prisoners of war and later American prisoners, according to the Dartmoor Prison Museum. By the 1920s, Dartmoor began housing British criminals. It is notorious for housing some of Britain’s most serious offenders, including murderers and gangsters. Among the most famous prisoners was Frank ‘The Mad Axeman’ Mitchell who escaped the prison and was never recaptured despite a large manhunt, the Museum said. Other infamous prisoners included Jack ‘The Hat’ McVitie and Jack ‘Spot’ Comer. Plans to close the prison were announced in 2013, but they were later scrapped. The Duchy of Cornwall estate also notably includes Highgrove House where King Charles and Camilla currently reside. According to The Daily Mail, King Charles will now have to pay $1.2 million (£700,000) in rent to Prince William, his new landlord. But ownership of the estate is lucrative.

Research in the financial psychology field has established that our life experiences create a set of financial beliefs that inform the way we think and feel about money. Commonalities',\n",

Millions of Australians are eligible for refunds after having paid for junk insurance products, with more than half not even aware they are eligible. New research from consumer remediation service Remediator, found that over 50 per cent of Australian consumers who have received junk insurance refunds either didn’t know they held the insurance in the first place or weren’t aware of all the exclusions that meant they would never be able to claim on the policy. Junk insurance refers to add-on insurances like Consumer Credit Insurance (CCI), Guaranteed Asset Protection (GAP), Mortgage Protection Insurance and Loan Protection Insurance.

The Royal Commission exposed the dodgy tactics banks and insurers used to sell these products, like paying as much as four times the commission to sales agents as was ever paid out to customers on policies. The average refund amount is $1,962.76, but some have received significantly more. Remediator said in recent weeks it has been able to deliver as much as $41,449 to a Victorian resident who had been paying for CCI. Remediator found that he had been paying for CCI on his Westpac Credit Card for over 10 years, but he never knowingly signed up for it in the first place. “I never thought in a million years I’d see anything refunded,” the man from Hoppers Crossing said. “It absolutely made my decade.” Another man, from Derrimut South Australia, received a $32,653 refund for CCI on a credit card. Remediator CEO Monique Gasson said now is the perfect time to find out if you were charged junk insurance. “With cost of living pressures so high',\n",

Florida’s insurance market was depleted long before Hurricane Ian made landfall, with six insurers deemed insolvent this year alone.\\n\\nThe aftermath of the most powerful storm to hit Southern Florida is expected to exacerbate the slow moving crisis further, leaving millions of residents in the state without insurance coverage.

Wall Street has fallen sharply following a solid jobs report for September that increased the likelihood the Federal Reserve will barrel ahead with an interest rate hiking campaign many investors fear will push the US economy into a recession. The Labor Department reported the unemployment rate fell to 3.5 per cent, lower than expectations of 3.7 per cent, in an economy that continues to show resilience despite the Fed\\'s efforts to bring down high inflation by weakening growth. Non-farm payrolls rose by 263,000 jobs, more than the 250,000 figure economists polled by Reuters had forecast. Money markets raised to 92 per cent the probability of a fourth straight 75 basis-point rate hike when Fed policymakers meet on Nov. 1-2, up from 83.4 per cent before the data. The job gains, lower unemployment rate and continued healthy wage growth point to a labour market Fed officials will likely still see as keeping inflation too high. In the latest of the hawkish messages by policymakers, New York Fed president John Williams said more rate hikes were needed to tackle inflation in a process that will likely increase unemployment. Friday\\'s data cemented another jumbo, 75 basis-point rate hike in November as \"the labour market is still way too hot for the Fed\\'s comfort zone\", said Bill Sterling, global strategist at GW&K Investment Management. \"This was a classic case of good news is bad news,\" he said. \"The market took the good news of the robust labour market report and turned it into an ever-more vigilant Fed and therefore potentially higher risks of a recession next year.\" Next week\\'s consumer price index will provide a key snapshot of where inflation stands. Despite Friday\\'s nosedive, a hefty two-day rally earlier in the week pushed the S&P 500, the Dow and the Nasdaq to post their first week of gains after three straight weeks of losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 630.15 points, or 2.11 per cent, at 29,296.79, the S&P 500 lost 104.86 points, or 2.80 per cent, to 3,639.66 and the',\n",

In our status-hungry brains, the question matters. Sometimes someone looks down their nose at your suburb. Is that still deserved? Or if you’re impressed by someone’s address, could its glitzy reputation be out of date? Impressions can well last longer than reality. Cities change over time. Gentrification sweeps across former working class suburbs, and they fill with people who would once have been called yuppies. As those suburbs rise in relative income, others must fall in relative terms. Also by Jason Murphy: What’s a soft landing for the economy and why is everyone talking about it? Australia's rental crisis: These cities are the worst affected From PMs to everyday workers: The Aussies taking on extra jobs Similarly in rural Australia – mining regions get rich and certain coastal areas become fashionable. Byron Bay and Karratha fill with the very wealthy, other parts of Australia must lose their sheen. But where? How does the pattern work? And can you use this information to buy a perfect house in a part of Australia that is suddenly unfashionable but actually still lovely? Or perhaps figure out which area will be the next to welcome a stampede of eager high-earners? Let’s start by looking at Australia overall. The biggest risers are rural, like the chunk of Tasmania’s west Coast around Granville Harbour and Zeehan, or the suddenly wealthy mining area of Springsure in Queensland. The area in Tasmania has climbed 56 pegs in the percentile ranks of median taxable income, while the Queensland zone has risen as astonishing 68, taking them from near the bottom to near the top. Meanwhile the big fallers are mostly in the cities. Wait, how does this analysis work? Here’s how: I calculated the median taxable income for each postcode for 2003-04 and 2019-20. Then I give each postcode a ranking at each time point. So the top ranking is 100, (it includes a bunch of postcodes that\",\n",

RateCity research director, Sally Tindall, said Australia’s property market could be in for a bumpy ride over the next year. “While some buyers’ budgets are shrinking, other buyers are tapping out altogether, in the hope of finding a cheaper deal down the track,” Tindall said. “In the boom, a ‘fear of missing out’ drove property prices higher.

Prince William is now the owner of a $1.7 billion (£1 billion) property portfolio, which includes one notorious property. As the new Duke of Cornwall, the royal has inherited his father King Charles’ impressive property portfolio known as the Duchy of Cornwall estate. The privately owned estate spans 52,000 hectares across England and Wales, and includes farmland, homes, commercial properties, forests, rivers and coastline. It also includes a prison.

The prison was first opened in 1809 as a depot for French prisoners of war and later American prisoners, according to the Dartmoor Prison Museum. By the 1920s, Dartmoor began housing British criminals. It is notorious for housing some of Britain’s most serious offenders, including murderers and gangsters. Among the most famous prisoners was Frank ‘The Mad Axeman’ Mitchell who escaped the prison and was never recaptured despite a large manhunt, the Museum said. Other infamous prisoners included Jack ‘The Hat’ McVitie and Jack ‘Spot’ Comer. Plans to close the prison were announced in 2013, but they were later scrapped. The Duchy of Cornwall estate also notably includes Highgrove House where King Charles and Camilla currently reside. According to The Daily Mail, King Charles will now have to pay $1.2 million (£700,000) in rent to Prince William, his new landlord. But ownership of the estate is lucrative. According to the estate’s annual financial reports, King Charles received an income of $36.5 million (£21 million) for the year ending 31 March 2022.
